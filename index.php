                        Here is some background information about me: I am Ibrahim from Syria.
                        I am a mechatronics engineer, graduated in 2015.
                        I have an ambition, and in order to fulfill it, I have to work hard, think smart,
                        and improve myself. My mother tongue is Arabic, and I am fluent in English.
                        I am an excellent computer user. Recently, I have become interested in web development; 
                        in fact, this website is my first project as a front-end web developer, and it was designed using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery Library and some PHP. Presently, my brief knowledge about back-end web development needs to be broadened, thus I am learning PHP.
                        <br>I am currently looking for a job. I would be happy to discuss possible work!
